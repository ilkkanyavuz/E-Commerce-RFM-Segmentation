## 🔍 Key Findings & Insights

The analysis revealed critical patterns in customer behavior, validating the Pareto Principle and highlighting retention opportunities:

**Pareto Principle Validated:** The **'Champions'** segment represents **23.23%** of the total customer base but generates a massive **64.21%** of the total revenue. This confirms that a quarter of the customers drive the majority of the business value.
**Critical Retention Warning:** The **'Customers At Risk'** segment has an average inactivity period of **161 days**. This timeframe marks the critical danger zone where immediate win-back campaigns are required to retain this high-value group.
**Overall Customer Health:** The customer base is generally active, with an **Average Recency** of **93.6 days**. Strategies should aim to lower this metric by encouraging more frequent purchases from 'New Customers'.
